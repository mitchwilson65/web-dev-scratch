    <h1>Interneting is easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>
    <p>By the way, whenever you're unsure of something, go to the MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) for answers</p>
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site.  There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an
        ordered list</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attentino to a
      particular word or phrase</p>

    <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize
      a word or phrase</p>

    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>


    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

    <p>thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>

    <p>Regards,<br>
